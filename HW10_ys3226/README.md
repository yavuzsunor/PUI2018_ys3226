# This is a markdown file to describe PUI2018 Homework10 for each assignment. 


## Assignment 1 
I work on the Anscomby dataset. I created two models(linear and quadratic) for both dependent variable(y1 & y2) using independent variable of x(and also x^2 for the quadratic model). I calculated the Likelihood ratio with using OLS function and manually and interpreted my results based on chi-sq table.


## Assignment 2
I worked on Energy consumption dataset and PLUTO dataset to come up with a coherent prediction model. I visualied the data points several time to see the correlation with naked eyes. Then, I created a linear and a quadratic model to fit a line and polynomial curve on the energy consumption datapoints. 


### We worked together with Max W Brueckner-Humphreys for some part of the Assignment 2(Energy and Pluto datasets).
