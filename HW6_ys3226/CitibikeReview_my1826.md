## Citibike Hypothesis review of my1826

a. 

The Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis seem correctly formulated. Only, to make them more solid, in the Null hypothesis I could have written "same or shorter" instead of "significantly different". And, as an idea, a specific time interval could have been added for a specific comparison between two groups.

b. 

Great - Getting rid of the outliers is really a good practice. 
Could be improved - The average trip durations could have been calculated according to different zones, days of the week or time intervals throughout the day. In that way, the distribution graph(not count but averages or percentages) could have been more clear to depict some different features for both group.
Great - Pointed out very good that two distributions represent almost same averages wiht the count graph in hand.

c.

I would reccomend to use z-test to test the Hypothesis; because the distributions look normal, variables are numerical, the variances are known and the sample size is large enough.
