### Reviews
- Clarity: 
  - The idea was great! However, first important thing I notice is the % of shooting among cities should not be plotted as a line chart, which might mislead readers to guess "trends" that may not exist at all. I would recommend to use a column chart like % of population as well.
  - The legend of % of shooting is not so clear. At first, I even think it means the % of black people who are shot.
  - The whole picture could be bigger
- Esthetic: All is good expect the city name in x axis could be rotated a certain degree to make it look better
- Honesty: Based on what I mentioned in Clarity(i), I think this plotting has a slight exaggeration of the % of shooting.
