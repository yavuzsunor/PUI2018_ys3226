Hi **ys3226**, thank you for the insightful plot highlighting **the % of shooting of black people vs. black people population**. Here are my comments and suggestions about your plot.  

### CLARITY: ###  

I somewhat understand what you're trying to convey, and I think that this is certainly an interesting topic, but to be honest, I'm not sure if the data really speaks through these plots. Yes, the red line chart seems to be above the % of population in almost every city, and it does convey your message (I think), I'm just not clear on what exactly the % of shooting of black people is. 

### AESTHETIC: ###

Colors are chosen appropriately, you did a nice job of conveying the line chart in red. I might have chosen differnt labels. For example, perhaps "African Americans" instead of "Black People" would have been a better choice. Black People can include other ethnicities as well. 

### HONESTY: ###

Great topic, and I'm certainly interested to see more analysis, but I wish you would have included more information about your data. These topics are somewhat broad, and I would have liked you to guide the viewer to your point in the caption.

Thank you for sharing! I'm happy to discuss more if you'd like.

Best,

Mark Bauer
