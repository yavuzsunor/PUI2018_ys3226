# This is a markdown file to describe PUI2018 Homework9 for each assignment. 
Important Note: I used my 72 hours extension for this homework.

I wrote my plot reviews for two of my classmates. You can see the reviews and the corresponding plots in the following md. files:

## Assignment 2
I worked on scatterplot visualization with errorbars, and also on two statsmodel linear regression methods, OLS and WLS respectively.

## Assignment 3
I downloaded the data from different sources and combined them. After necessary data cleaning processes, I visualized the data in various ways, and also used different linear regression methods to fit a line to corresponding data points.


### We worked together with Max W Brueckner-Humphreys for the first data wrangling part of Assignment 3(mass shootings).
