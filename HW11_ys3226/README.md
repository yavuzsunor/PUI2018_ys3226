# This is a markdown file to describe PUI2018 Homework11 for each assignment. 


## Assignment 1 
I worked on the MTA turnstyle dataset for times series analysis. 

For the first part, I plotted the timeseries by taking averages for the first two axises. Then I used a threshold of 6 std to capture the event.

For the second part, I visualized the time series using two for loops and then used chageFinder function to capture the steepest increase and decrese. The function didnot work well for the decrease part for some reason, so that's why I crated my own function and came up with the steepest increase and decrease.


## Assignment 2
I re-plotted my plot from the HW8 according to the my peer reviews. I basically changed the lineplot for one variable to the barplot, made the plot bigger and explained my labels more clear conveying my message better.
